# Home

- The top title strip shows SPCBOY, the current console and album, and CPU use.
- Window controls are rendered in the title strip; AppKit's native stoplights
  are hidden, and the strip remains draggable.
- Transport, library view, and fold controls share the sidebar toolbar. Search
  occupies the matching sidebar cell in the lower status strip; the catalog
  tree fills the remaining scrollable area.
- The footer aligns to the sidebar split and shows elapsed time, track length,
  and playlist length at right.
- Startup reads the shared CocoaSpice catalog through CatalogReader; ScanSong
  remains its writer.
- Options open in the playlist pane as a subpage and leave the title and footer
  visible. A separate Options window uses the same chrome.
- Dense catalog rows keep zero vertical item padding with a 1px row gap. The
  toolbar, playlist header, and search strip share deliberate heights.
