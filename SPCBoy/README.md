SPCBoy is a macOS player for game-music libraries: browse folders or a game-and-console database, preview a game in the playlist, and play it directly from ordinary files or supported archives.

It is built for large collections. SPCBoy reads a catalog produced by the shared native MediaScanner, archive playback uses bounded disposable materialization, and search is one consistent temporary view across Folders and Database modes.

Playback includes Native Long Play, repeat and shuffle controls, faded skips, a 10-band EQ, decoder-specific play speed, and a small theme system for the interface. Overlapping decoder support can be routed in Options.

## Historical run instructions

These commands describe the archived Electron implementation and are not part
of the maintained or verified build path.

1. Run `./launch.sh`.
2. SPCBoy opens the CocoaSpice catalog at `~/Library/Application Support/CocoaSpice/Library.sqlite` in SQLite query-only mode. To use another canonical catalog, choose it in **Options → Database → Library Database** and restart SPCBoy.
3. Library roots and catalog controls are read-only in SPCBoy. Use the standalone MediaScanner app or CLI to add roots, scan, rebuild, cancel, and resume. The former JavaScript catalog scanner is not part of SPCBoy.
4. Select a final sidebar item to preview it; double-click it or press Return to play.

Database activation reads the exact source, archive member, and subtrack rows
published by MediaScanner and places them in SPCBoy's playlist. Playback-time
archive materialization and display inspection never write back to the catalog.

For local development: `npm test` and `npm run check`.
