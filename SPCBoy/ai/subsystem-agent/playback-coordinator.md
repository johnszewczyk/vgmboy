# Playback Coordinator

## Scope

- Renderer ownership of track transitions, timing, progress, and playback lifecycle while VGMBoy owns all decoded output.

## Ownership

- `web/app-playback.js` remains the coordinator entry point while the backend-specific decoders stay behind their existing preload APIs.
- `electron/playback-core.js` owns format-admission policy only; it must not own output routing, renderer timing, or UI state.
- Every admitted backend declares the same required VGMBoy bridge; native IPC is the sole output route.
- `electron/playback-core.js` is the single backend capability registry. Preload exposes its data-only renderer view and `web/playback-backends.js` builds the renderer lookup from that view.
- Native helpers own decoding and device/session mechanics, not track selection or progress-slider policy.
- The native decoder contract is worker-owned; decoder adapters must not be called from the Core Audio callback.

## Invariants

- One active playback transition may mutate the native or Web Audio session at a time.
- Every transition carries a track identity and generation; stale completions must not start, pause, seek, or report state for another track.
- Progress is measured from the active output clock and clamped to the active track duration.
- Native and Web Audio backends use the same coordinator clamp for elapsed position updates.
- Backend selection is based on the materialized playable path, including archive members.
- Long Play changes duration policy only; it must not change backend selection.
- Renderer-PCM backends currently include OpenMPT `.xm` and standard audio containers; their chunk decoder is selected by the materialized playable extension.

## Lifecycle

- A transition resolves the playable path, opens the selected backend session, starts output, and then publishes state for that same track.
- Stop and replacement invalidate the prior generation before releasing its audio resources.
- Seek replaces or repositions the active session through the same serialized transition path.

## Failure Boundaries

- Decoder failures leave playback stopped and must not resurrect a previous track.
- Empty or invalid PCM is a backend failure, not a valid silent session.
- UI progress updates must not drive decoder work faster than the coordinator's clock.
