# Shared Catalog Boundary

## Scope

- Selected catalog path, visible roots, and the boundary between CocoaSpice and
  the standalone ScanSong.

## Ownership

- ScanSong owns root mutation, Scan, Rebuild, cancellation, resume,
  diagnostics, link maintenance, and every catalog write.
- CocoaSpice owns only catalog path selection, explicit read-only reload, and
  presentation of indexed games and files.
- `OptionsView` directs users to ScanSong for every catalog-maintenance action.

## Invariants

- CocoaSpice never initializes a scan controller in its production app model.
- CocoaSpice exposes no library-root or maintenance controls.
- The selected catalog is validated as schema 23 before its path is persisted.
- A catalog switch requires restart and never replaces a live SQLite handle.
  Reloading the active catalog is safe: it invalidates read-only sidebar
  snapshots and opens fresh reader connections without touching playback.
- ScanSong preserves the catalog's durable SQLite journal mode (including
  WAL) so active CocoaSpice and SPCBoy readers can continue while it writes.
- Playback archive materialization and cache remain transient playback concerns
  behind shared FrontendCore services; they never become scan writes.

## Failure Boundaries

- Missing, invalid, or incompatible catalogs surface an error; CocoaSpice does
  not create or repair them.
- Query failure retains the last valid sidebar snapshot.
- Playback telemetry may update the in-memory playback display only; it never supplies catalog metadata.
- Games playlist hydration is owned by `CatalogPlaylistCore`. Folder-system and
  metadata-system fallback branches preserve the `tracks_game_sidebar_index`
  access path; a root-wide `OR` fallback, source-path walk, decoder call, or
  full UI rebuild is not an acceptable replacement.
